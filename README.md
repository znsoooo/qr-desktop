# QR Desktop
Generate a __QR-Code__ is the most simplest thing today. 
Look at `Clipboard` and make QR-Code by __hotkey__ is also not too difficult.
Many people make this function in __different frameworks__.
Like someone build it by `electron`, size 30.2 MiB, and I wrote one by `python`, size 14 MiB. 
But wrote it by `C++` is complicated. It will be faster, and smaller, about __280 kB__, and cross-platformed, working well at `Windows XP` and above.
