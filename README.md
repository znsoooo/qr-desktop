# QR Desktop
Generate a __QR-Code__ is the most simplest thing today.  
Reading `Clipboard` and make QR-Code by __hotkey__ is also not so difficult.  
People make wheels in __different frameworks__.  
Someone build it by `electron`, size __30.2 MB__, and I wrote one by `python`, size __14.1 MB__.  
Wrote by `C` is difficult, but minimalist and fastest, I finished it with size of __18 KB__.  
It working on `Windows XP` and above, compatible with `32/64-bit` system.
