# QR Desktop
Generate a __QR-Code__ is the most simplest thing today.  
Monitor the `Clipboard` or make QR-Code by __hotkey__ is also not so difficult.  
People make this function in __different frameworks__.  
Someone build it by `electron`, size __30.2 MB__, and I wrote one by `python`, size __14.1 MB__.  
Wrote it by `C++` will be complicated, but faster, and smaller, and clean.  
I accomplish it in __79 KB__, it working on `Windows XP` and above, compatible with `32/64-bit` system.
